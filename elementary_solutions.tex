\section{Moocraft}
$40$ minutes is $40 \cdot 60 = 2400$ seconds.
Three-fourths of this is $2400 \cdot \frac{3}{4} = 1800$.
Five-sevenths of $1800$ is $1800 \cdot \frac{5}{7} \approx 1285.71$.
Therefore the answer rounded to the nearest integer is $1286$ seconds.

\section{Farmer Pearson's Pears}
Five dozen is $5 \cdot 12 = 60$.
$60$ pears is $\frac{60}{18} \approx 3.33$ packs.
Since Farmer Pearson only sells whole packs, Cowboy Alex needs to buy $4$ packs.

\section{Cowbe}
After Bessie chose her corner, there are seven corners left for Elsie to choose.
Three of those corners are connected with Bessie's corner by an edge.
Therefore, the probability is $\frac{3}{7}$.

\section{Accowntant}
Billy has $\$21$ more than Bobby, Bailey has $\$13$ more than Billy, and Betty has $\$17$ more than Bailey.
Therefore, Betty has $21 + 13 + 17 = 51$ dollars more than Bobby.

\section{Moovie Night}
$10$ out of $18$ grams of food or drink that Bessie consumes is popcorn, so the amount of popcorn that she consumed is $\frac{10}{18} \cdot 3060 = 1700$ grams.
Alternatively, we can use a system of equations.
If $a$ is the amount of popcorn that Bessie consumed in grams and $b$ is the amount of Cocow-Cola that she consumed in grams, we have $\frac{a}{10} = \frac{b}{8}$ and $a + b = 3060$.
The first equation is equivalent to $b = \frac{4}{5}a$, and substituting this into the second equation gives $a + \frac{4}{5}a = 3060$.
This means that $\frac{9}{5}a = 3060$, so $a = 1700$.

\section{Cowculus}
If the workbook's weight is $x$ pounds, then the textbook's weight is $0.8x$.
Therefore, $x = 0.8x + 10$, so $0.2x = 10$ and $x = 50$.
The workbook weights $50$ pounds, so the textbook weights $40$ pounds and the combined weight is $90$ pounds.

\section{Pocowmon Cards}
Let $a$ be the number of cards that Bessie has and $b$ be the number of cards that Bailey has.
From what Bessie said, we have $\frac{a + 4}{3} = \frac{b - 4}{2}$.
From what Bailey said, we have $b + 18 = 4(a - 18)$.
We can simplify the first equation to $2a - 3b = -20$ and the second equation to $4a - b = 90$.
Multiplying the first equation by $2$ and the subtracting the two equations gives $-5b = -110$, so $b = 22$.
Substituting this into either of the two equations lets us find $a$, which is $28$.

\section{Spot the Brown Cows}
We can use a two-way table to represent the data:
\begin{center}
	\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|}
		\hline
                 & Brown spots & No brown spots & Total \\ \hline
		Calf     & $15$        &                & $41$  \\ \hline
		Not calf &             & $45$           &       \\ \hline
		Total    &             &                & $100$ \\ \hline
	\end{tabular}
\end{center}
For any row or column with two known numbers, we can fill in the remaining empty space by adding or subtracting.
The number of calfs with no brown spots is $41 - 15 = 26$, so the total number of cows with no brown spots is $26 + 45 = 71$.
The number of cows with brown spots is then $100 - 71 = 29$.
The completed two-way table looks like this:
\begin{center}
	\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|}
		\hline
                 & Brown spots & No brown spots & Total \\ \hline
		Calf     & $15$        & $26$           & $41$  \\ \hline
		Not calf & $14$        & $45$           & $59$  \\ \hline
		Total    & $29$        & $71$           & $100$ \\ \hline
	\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\section{Look Mom No Proof!}
The first rule in the paper checks for divisibility by $2$, the second rule checks for divisibility by $5$, and the third rule checks for divisibility by $3$.
Therefore, the paper is claiming that any integer greater than $5$ which is not a multiple of $2$, $3$, or $5$ is either a a prime or a power of a prime.
To disprove this, we can find a number that is not a multiple of $2$, $3$, or $5$ and is not a prime or a power of a prime.
Our number must have at least two different prime factors in order for it to not be a power of a prime, and we can't have $2$, $3$, or $5$ as prime factors.
We can just take any two primes that aren't $2$, $3$, or $5$ and multiply them together.
For example, one answer would be $7 \cdot 11 = 77$.
