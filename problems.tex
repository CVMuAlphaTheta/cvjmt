\section*{Moocraft}
Bessie the Cow's new hobby is trying to beat the video game Moocraft as fast as possible.
On the first day, Bessie finished Moocraft in $40$ minutes.
The next day, Bessie finished Moocraft in three-fourths of the time it took the day before.
On the third day, Bessie's time is five-sevenths of the time on the second day.
How many seconds did it take for Bessie to complete Moocraft on the third day?
Round your answer to the nearest integer.

\section*{Farmer Pearson's Pears}
Cowboy Alex just ran out of fresh fruit!
He decided to visit Farmer Pearson for some of his world-famous pears.
Farmer Pearson puts together $18$ pears in one pack and he only sells whole packs.
If Cowboy Alex wants to buy at least five dozen pears, how many packs does he need to buy?

\section*{Cowbe}
Bessie the Cow found a cube.
She random$y$ chose one corner of the cube, and Elsie random$y$ chose a different corner of the cube.
What is the probability that the corner which Bessie chose and the corner which Elsie chose are connected by an edge of the cube?

\section*{Moolan}
On a trip to China, Bessie the Cow met a cow named Moolan. 
Apparently, Moolan was once a great cow warrior! 
If Bessie triples Moolan's age and subtracts $50$, she gets her own age.
If Bessie quadruples her own age and subtracts $53$, she gets Moolan's age.
How old is Moolan?

\section*{Accowntant}
Bessie the Cow is counting her siblings’ money to determine how much allowance they should get. 
Bobby has $\$21$ less than Billy. 
Bailey has $\$13$ more than Billy. 
Bailey has $\$17$ less than Betty. 
How many more dollars does Betty have than Bobby?

\section*{Moovie Night}
Farmer Julia built a new theater for Bessie the Cow and her friends! 
Bessie likes to eat popcorn and drink Cocow-Cola when watching moovies.
Bessie drinks $8$ grams of Cocow-Cola for every $10$ grams of popcorn that she eats.
If the total mass of the popcorn and the Cocow-Cola that she consumed is $3060$ grams, how many grams of popcorn did she eat?

\section*{Cowculus}
Bessie the Cow really enjoys doing math, so she decided to order two cowculus books from the Barnyard Bazaar: the first book is a cowculus textbook, and the second is a cowculus workbook.
When they arrived, Bessie noticed that the books were really heavy!
The textbook's weight is $20\%$ less than the workbook's weight.
The workbook weighs $10$ pounds more than the textbook.
What is the combined weight of the two cowculus books?

\section*{Pocowmon Cards}
Farmer Julia bought some Pocowmon cards for her cows!
While Bessie the Cow and her sister, Bailey the Cow are trading their Pocowmon cards, they notice something interesting.
Bessie tells Bailey, ``If you give me $4$ cards, the ratio between the number of cards I have and the number of cards you have will be $3 : 2$.''
Bailey then tells Bessie, ``If you give me $18$ cards, I will have four times as many cards as you.''
How many Pocowmon cards does Bessie have?

\section*{Spot the Brown Cows}
On Rancher Cedric's farm, there are $100$ cows. 
$41$ are calves, and $15$ of the calves have brown spots.
$45$ of the cows are not calves and don't have brown spots.
How many cows have brown spots?

\section*{Look Mom No Proof! (Elementary School Version)}
Bessie the Cow found a website called \url{vixra.org} which mostly publishes scientific nonsense.
There's a paper (\url{https://vixra.org/abs/2008.0229}) which presents a simple method that supposedly checks whether integers greater than $5$ are prime.
It makes the following statement without proof:
\begin{displayquote}
    The answer to whether the given numbers are prime numbers is to check that:
    \begin{enumerate}[label=\alph*)]
        \item The numbers are not even numbers (the last digit is not divisible by $2$);
        \item The last digit of numbers in not $5$;
        \item The sum of the digits of each of the remaining numbers is not divisible by $3$.
    \end{enumerate}
    A number that meets the above criteria is either a prime or a power [of a] prime.
\end{displayquote}
Find a counterexample that disproves this claim.
(This problem has multiple correct answers.
You only need to find one of them.)

\section*{Revomootion}
Farmer John's cows are planning revolution to overthrow him!
The $42$ cows plan to distribute themselves among $6$ pastures.
To make sure Farmer John doesn't get suspicious, there must be at least two cows in each pasture, each pasture must have a different number of cows, and pasture can have exactly $3$ or $3$ cows.
To help the cows calculate their chance of succeeding, find the greatest number of cows that can be in any one pasture.

\section*{On the Moove}
Bessie the Cow and her sister Bailey the Cow leave their barn at the same time, running at a constant speed on a narrow and straight road.

\section*{Soccow}
Rancher Cedric decided to hold a soccow tournament for his cows.
Bessie the Cow's team, the Tactful Tauruses, lost $8$ or their first $10$ games.
If they will play $30$ more games in this tournament, how many of the remaining games do they need to win in order to make the total number of games which they won at least twice as much as the total number of games which they lost?

\section*{Green Cows 1}
Help Bessie the Cow answer the question ``How much grass can a green cow chow if green cows can chow grass?''
Bessie and Elsie both chow grass at constant rates.
If Bessie can chow all the grass in a field in $3$ hours and Elsie can chow all the grass in the same field in $4$ minutes, how long will it take for them to chow all the grass in this field together?
Express your answer in exact form.

\section*{Green Cows 2}
Bessie the Cow still hasn't figured out how much grass a green cow can chow if green cows can chow grass.
If $5$ green cows can chow $8$ square meters of grass in $20$ minutes, how many green cows are needed to chow $10$ square meters of grass in at most $15$ minutes?

Bessie the Cow wanted to learn how to do magic, but she got distracted on the internet and ended up learning about magic squares.
In a magic square, the sum of the numbers in each row, each column, and the two main diagonals are the same.
If exactly two numbers are changed in this grid, the result is a magic square.
Which two numbers must be changed and what values should they be changed?

\section*{Mooish}
Farmer Paul has two types of cows: truthy cows and falsy cows.
Physically, they are indistinguishable.
They all speak mooish, and they can be distinguished by how they answer questions.
The truthy cows always reply truthfully, and the falsy cows always lie.
Bessie had a conversation with three of Farmer Paul's cows: Annabelle, Betsie, and Cornelius.
Here's a translation of the conversation.
\begin{displayquote}
    Bessie: Are any of you falsy? \\
    Annabelle: At least one of us is falsy. \\
    Bessie: Are Bossy and Cornelius both truthy? \\
    Bossy: Yes.
    Bessie: Are Annabelle and Bossy both truthy? \\
    Cornelius: No.
\end{displayquote}
What is the type of each cow?

\section*{Cowkies}
When Bessie the Cow was visiting a nearby farm, she noticed that there is a large group of cows.
She brought some cookies to make new cow friends, but she didn't know how many cows there were in the group!
She counted a total of $87$ black spots $83$ white spots.
Each cow either has two black spots and three white spots or three black spots and two white spots.
How many cows are in the group, not including Bessie?

\section*{Moorio Kart}
Cowboy Alex gave Bessie the Cow a new racing game called Moorio Kart!
She let all one hundred of her cow friends play, and then asked each cow whether they liked each of the three courses.
$86$ cows said they liked Bowser Cowstle, $25$ cows said they liked Cowconut Mall, and $67$ cows said they liked Moo Moo Meadows.
Some cows might have liked two courses, and no cow liked all three courses.
What is the fewest possible number of friends which Bessie could have had?

\section*{Moo York Bagels}
Bessie the Cow now lives in Moo York and every day she buys a bagel from Billie the Bagel Cow.
The type of bagel that she buys depends on her mood.
If Bessie is happy, she will spend $\$1000$ on a toasted blueberry bagel.
If Bessie is sad, she will spend $\$620$ on a strawberry cream cheese bagel.
On any given day Bessie has a $68\%$ chance of being happy.
On average, how much does Bessie spend on the bagels each day?
Round your answer to the nearest cent.

\section*{Mooilk}
Farmer Julia wants to measure out exactly $25.5$ gallons of milk in a large storage bin. 
The bin is initially empty. 
Farmer Julia has a $2$ gallon bucket and a $3.5$ gallon bucket. 
In one move, she can add $2$ gallons of milk to the bin or add $3.5$ gallons of milk to the bin. 
If there is at least $5$ gallons of milk in the bin, she can also remove $2$ gallons of milk or remove $3.5$ gallons of milk in one move. 
What is the least possible number of moves needed to end with exactly $15$ gallons of milk in the bin?

\section*{Completely Organic Watermelons (C.O.W.)}
Bessie the Cow was looking through the Barnyard Bazaar for some fresh produce when she spotted some Completely Organic Watermelons!
Bella the Watermelon Cow has $18$ \emph{different} watermelons for sale: $5$ are large, $6$ are medium, and $7$ are small.
Bessie wants to buy three watermelons that aren't all the same size.
(In other words, she wants to buy three watermelons of at least two different sizes.)
In how many ways can this be done?
The order in which she buys them doesn't matter, but each watermelon is unique and different from other watermelons of the same size.

\section*{The Great Cow Chase}
Oh no! Kiran the cow is making an escape!
Kiran is $10$ miles south of Farmer John, and he starts running east at $15$ miles per hour.
Farmer John can move at $30$ miles per hour.
How long will it take for Farmer John to catch Kiran if Farmer John uses the fastest possible strategy?
Express your answer in seconds, rounded to the nearest integer.

\section*{Rowdy Cow}
After Rancher Cedric caught Kiran the cow in the Great Cow Chase, Kiran decided to trample the grass and terrorize the chickens.
Rancher Cedric had enough, and he decided to lock him in a pen.
The pen is in the shape of an equilateral triangle, and each side is $500$ meters long.
The rowdy cow is tied to one corner, so that the portion of the field it can reach is exactly half of the total area.
If Kiran and the rope both have zero width, how long is the rope in meters?
Express your answer as a decimal rounded to two digits after the decimal point.

\section*{My Cow Ate My Homework}
Bessie the Cow obtained Chloe's math homework again.
While she was enjoying this tasty snack, she noticed one problem that seemed very interesting.
Here's the problem statement:
\begin{displayquote}
